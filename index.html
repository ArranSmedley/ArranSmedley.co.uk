In today’s work environment, good communication and people skills and very important characteristics which a successful individual must have and I always try my hardest to ensure I come across as a confident but easy to approach individual.</p>

                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">Through university projects, summer internships and other tasks, I have gained a good understanding of strict deadlines and the pressure which comes with it. Most of these experiences have been gained from a software internship I completed throughout the summer of 2019 down in Newbury, England.</p>

					<p class="scroll-animated-from-right">My previous work experiences which are highlighted later, have not only helped to enhance my communication skills with customers, but also with colleagues. To help ensure that any tasks can be dealt with as efficiently and effectively as possible and listening to others making sure I adapt to different scenarios if need be to help the team.</p>
